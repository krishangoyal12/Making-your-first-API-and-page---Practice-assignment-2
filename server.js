// Boilerplate Code for HTTP Status Code API
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

/*
Task:
You need to create an API that helps users understand different HTTP status codes and their meanings.

Requirements:
1. Create a GET endpoint at "/status-info".
2. The endpoint should accept a "code" as a query parameter (e.g., /status-info?code=200).
3. Based on the status code provided, the API should respond with:
   a. The status code.
   b. A description of the status code.

Example Responses:
- For 200 (OK):
  Request: /status-info?code=200
  Response:
  {
    "status": 200,
    "message": "OK: The request has succeeded. The meaning of this status depends on the HTTP method used."
  }

- For 404 (Not Found):
  Request: /status-info?code=404
  Response:
  {
    "status": 404,
    "message": "Not Found: The server has not found anything matching the request URI. This is often caused by a missing page or resource."
  }

- For 500 (Internal Server Error):
  Request: /status-info?code=500
  Response:
  {
    "status": 500,
    "message": "Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request."
  }

- For 400 (Bad Request):
  Request: /status-info?code=400
  Response:
  {
    "status": 400,
    "message": "Bad Request: The server cannot process the request due to client-side errors (e.g., malformed syntax)."
  }

List of Status Codes to Handle:
200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504
*/

const messages = {
  200: "Request was successful.",
  201: "A resource has been successfully created.",
  204: "Request processed successfully, no content returned.",
  400: "The request is invalid due to client-side errors.",
  401: "Authentication is required to access the resource.",
  403: "Server refuses to authorize the request.",
  404: "The resource does not exist.",
  405: "HTTP method not supported for this resource.",
  429: "User has exceeded rate limits.",
  500: "The server encountered an error.",
  502: "The server received an invalid response from the upstream server.",
  503: "Server temporarily overloaded or under maintenance.",
  504: "The server did not receive a timely response from the upstream server."

}

app.get('/status-info', (req,res)=>{
  const code = parseInt(req.query.code)

 if(!code || !messages[code]){
  return res.status(400).json({
      error: 'bad request',
      message : `Code does not exist`
  })
 }

 res.json({
  status: code,
  message: messages[code]
 })
})



const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Status Code API is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
